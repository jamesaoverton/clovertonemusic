           "Don Carlos' Dream is an intense Flamenco piece in 6/8 time. It features tight chord voicings to bring out the intensity of the piece, as well as an ostinato bass-line to anchor the ensemble.The drums can use a multitude of rimshots, castanets, and cymbals to create the feeling of dancing in the mountains of Andalusia, Spain. The piece features the melody and a solo for the baritone sax, as well as a solo for the piano. During the piano solo, the horn players clap a Flamenco pattern to simulate the rhythms of the castanets, and the stamping of Flamenco dancers.!"]]]
