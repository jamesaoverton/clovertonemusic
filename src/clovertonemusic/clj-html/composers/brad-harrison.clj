His teachers have included Jim Spragg, Brian O’Kane, John MacLeod, Brigham Philips, Steven Crowe, and Steve McDade."]

Interestingly enough, Brad may be the only person to have played hockey and the national anthem at both Maple Leaf Gardens and the Air Canada Center. His varied career has allowed him the privilege of sharing the stage with such acclaimed artists as The Canadian Brass, Alistair Kay, Alain Trudel, Hilario Duran, Dave Douglas, and Randy Brecker."]
