        "Driven by an endless need for expressing herself creatively, young composer and multi-instrumentalist Chelsea McBride has burst onto the Toronto jazz scene. Still only 24, McBride has performed at the TD Toronto Jazz Festival, Beaches Jazz Festival and the Rex Hotel. She’s also worked alongside many local jazz artists including Brownman Ali and William Carn and studied with acclaimed musicians David Occhipinti, Darcy James Argue and Mike Allen.\nBorn and raised in Vancouver B.C., Chelsea was surrounded and fascinated by music. She started playing piano at the age of 3, and saxophone throughout elementary school. By the end of high school she had already performed in competitions at provincial and national levels. In 2014, she graduated from the Humber Bachelor of Music program in Toronto, ON and was the first recipient of the Toronto Arts Foundation’s Emerging Jazz Artist award. Whether it’s her big band (Chelsea McBride’s Socialist Night School), her pop-fusion band (Chelsea and the Cityscape), her jazz trio (Chelsea McBride Group), or her video game cover band (Koopa Troop), Chelsea is a diverse musician who refuses to stay in one creative box. Aside from her own projects, she also regularly performs with other local acts including the Brad Cheeseman Group, Skirt Check, Soul Finger and Elton Joan. Chelsea can be heard around Toronto playing several shows per month. She has released two EPs with Chelsea and the Cityscape and one EP with Socialist Night School. "]
