It features the trombone and tenor sax on the main melody and in the improvising section. It also has some space for the drums at the end. This chart is a good opportunity to teach your students about a broken Jazz 2 feel and how it’s different than a 4 feel or from a 2 feel in the early days of Jazz."]]]

And yes, I was in that ensemble. The Phone Don’t Ring Jack is a feature for trombone, with a trumpet solo on the double-time section. The trumpet solo could just as effectively be taken by one of the saxophones in the band. The difficulty level is advanced, with a challenging lead trumpet part (up to Eb) and fairly complex rhythms.\""]]]
