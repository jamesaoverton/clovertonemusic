           "“La Squadra Di Milano” is another great and groovy grade 1 rock tune thats more of a strut. It was inspired my Italian cop movies. It’s got some easy rhythms that are great for beginner bands but is still very musical and a lot of fun. It has melody sections in the saxes and as a full band and features a solo section written for alto sax. The attitude really comes though the music and will have your band wanting to play it week in and week out."]]]

The melody is featured in the alto sax, tenor sax, and trumpet, then unison melodies in the saxes vs the brass. It’s a great way to introduce your students to section playing. Improvising can be for any player. !"]]]
